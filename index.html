  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>Hi, my name is Jason Caryl. I grew up in Syracuse, NY and went to undergrad in Rochester, NY at RIT. Upon graduating, I followed my college friends to New York City. I've been working as a designer and living on the Lower East Side ever since.</p>
  <p>I hold these traits close to my heart: creativity, exploration, and imagination. I think like an artist and a craftsman which makes me a bit of a perfectionist at times. I was trained by a number of professors to make sure everything I make is frustratingly pixel perfect.</p>

  <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
  <p>I grew up in the snow covered hills of Syracuse, NY. There was a lot of oppurtunities for skiing and I took full advantage from a very young age.</p>

  <h1>More About Me</h1>
  <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
  <p>I try to spend the majority of my free time drawing, reading, playing board games with friends, playing soccer, and rock climbing at <a href="http://brooklynboulders.com/brooklyn/">Brooklyn Boulders</a> (mostly bouldering).</p>
  
  <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
  <p>The dream long ago was to work at an animation studio or in the comic book industry. Lately, I've been thinking it wouldn't be so bad working at a creative lab or a R&D department making strange artsy digital things.</p>
  
  <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
  <p>I've been getting back into podcasts lately. <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/">Radiolab</a>, <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/">This American Life</a>, <a href="http://99percentinvisible.org/">99% Invisible</a>, <a href="http://thetruthpodcast.com/The_Truth.html">The Truth</a> and <a href="http://www.thecollectivepodcast.com/">The Collective Podcast</a> are the shows I frequent most often.</p>
